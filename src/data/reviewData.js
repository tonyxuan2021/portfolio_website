    text: "Working with Tony was phenomenal throughout the duration of our first hackathon during bootcamp. He is very methodical in his process of breaking problems down as he thinks more so of the best logical next step rather than a list of randomized guesses of solving. During our first hackathon, he demonstrated this ability through the troubleshooting we had with our application. Although my first thought was to blindly try to fix the problems we had, Tony came forward with a more compartmentalized approach that saved us hours of debugging.",
