    text: "Working with Tony was phenomenal throughout the duration of our first hackathon during bootcamp. He is very methodical in his process of breaking problems down as he thinks more so of the best logical next step rather than a list of randomized guesses of solving. During our first hackathon, he demonstrated this ability through the troubleshooting we had with our application. Although my first thought was to blindly try to fix the problems we had, Tony came forward with a more compartmentalized approach that saved us hours of debugging.",

    text: "Tony is synonymous of great leadership and hard work! We had the opportunity to work together in a hackathon and a group project during BrainStation Bootcamp. Both on the hackathon and in our InStock team; Tony was always able to accomplish 120%. He was always skilled and proficient while working alongside an agile team and overall as a full stack web developer. His kind demeanor and natural sense of leadership made a great difference during our team projects. I would be more than happy to work with him again in any scenario because he truly is an amazing professional to work with.",
